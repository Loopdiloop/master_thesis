Files and extra information relating to my thesis.

Thesis handed in 20th of April 2021, at the Department of Physics, University of Oslo.

Main subject: Nuclear astrophysics, where I extracted data on the gSF and NLD of 187-188Re. The gSF and NLD are statistical features important for calcuating cross sections, and this work enables the first experimental constraint on the 186Re(n,g)187Re cross section, which is important for the s-process branching point. Finding this cross section is the next step of this research, which is due to be done after a bit of a break.

All Oslo method software matrices and results are located in mama_d (for 188Re) and mama_t (for 187Re).
There, the subfolders are runs of different systematics, i.e. input and normalization constants. By having read the thesis, especially the results on systematic errors, it should be understandible. The errors themselves are calculated and plotted by the systematic errors python3 scripts of plot/ .

Plot/ is a folder with a lot of python scripts to plot data and calculate some things for the result. It is worth a look if you are interested in the work, though the scripts are not specifically well-written. The plots in plot/png and plot/matrices are worth a look. These contain most of my results.

Figures/ is a folder of an assortment of not-generated-by-a-python-script figures. Contains both figures added in the thesis and not.

Calibration/ contains some calculations of calibration constants, but is probably not the most interesting and it is a bit messy.

The folder scripts/, ironically, contains a single script to plot some of the scissors-resonance work.


Thank you to all who have joined me on this wild ride to finish this. I appreciate you all.
A special thank you to my dear main supervisor Ann-Cecilie, you have been great!


Any bug in the thesis is now a feature. 

Cheers, Marianne.



Edit: Forgot to mention usersort, but it does contain files and software for sorting the data.
  Any input, .root or raw file is available upon request.
