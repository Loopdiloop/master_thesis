These matrices are copies of the ones in the parent folder. 

There is a small bug in the saving of the matrices from mama, which means that there is a broken character at the end of the time stamps which python and/or text editors do not really like. I have a workaround in matrix_plot.py in plot/, but it's not as reliant as I need and it's easier to manually remove it.
If you however, try to open the edited file without the faulty charater, mama will not be able to read it. Yes, I tried, and yes, I learned the hard way.
