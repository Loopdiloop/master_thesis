 1. Sort ALFNA(Eg,Ex) from experiment 
 2. Use rm in mama and unfold ALFNA -> unfolded 
 3. Use fg in mama and extract first-generation matrix fg 
 4. Run rhosigchi on fg 
 5. Run counting 
 6. Run run counting.cpp, spincut.cpp and sigext.cpp in ROOT
 7. Run normalization 
 8. Run strength.cpp in ROOT Please, see the MSU_Workshop_2015 on https://github.com/oslocyclotronlab
